### Research question

Is it possible to use LLaMa v2 to create a low-cost Virtual Assistant in terms of usage,
to help Arch Linux users to manage theirs Operative System, getting specific purpose suggestions,
and solving general question about their installed packages (Software)?

#### Objective

- Create a Virtual Assistant that using LLaMa v2, provides suggestions of usage under previous installed software context of each user Operative System

##### Goals

- Get a Virtual Assistant that uses a pre-trained LLaMa v2 to solve general question about the current state of the Operative System of each user
- Get a Virtual Assistant that uses a pre-trained LLaMa v2 to solve specific question about the Operative System of each user
