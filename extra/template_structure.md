### Research question

Is it feasible to utilize LLaMa v2 to construct a cost-efficient Virtual Assistant capable of assisting Arch Linux users in managing their operating systems, providing context-specific suggestions, and addressing general software-related inquiries?

### Hypothesis

The integration of LLaMa v2 into a Virtual Assistant for Arch Linux users has the potential to significantly enhance system management and user experience, offering valuable insights and automated solutions.

#### Objectives

- Develop a Virtual Assistant utilizing pre-trained LLaMa v2.
- Provide general information about the current state of the user's operating system.
- Offer context-specific suggestions based on the installed software.
- Address specific inquiries related to the Arch Linux operating system.

### Methodology

1. Pre-training the LLaMa v2 Model:

- Data Collection:
    - Gather a diverse and representative dataset from the Arch Linux wiki, man pages, and Ubuntu's wiki.
    - Ensure the dataset covers a wide range of topics related to Linux systems, software, and operations.

- Pre-processing:
    - Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove irrelevant information, noise, or duplicate content. To aim this purpose a shell (Bash) script must be created
    - Tokenize and structure the data to facilitate effective learning.

- Pre-training:
    - Utilize the pre-processed dataset to pre-train the LLaMa v2 model.
    - Leverage transfer learning to enhance the model's understanding of Linux-specific language and context.

2. Fine-tuning for Individual Users using LSTM:

- User-Specific Data:
    - Collect user-specific data, possibly including historical commands, preferences, and interactions with the Virtual Assistant.

- Fine-tuning Process:
    - Fine-tune the pre-trained LLaMa v2 model for each individual user using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
    - This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to each user's unique requirements and language nuances.

3. Evaluation:

- Performance Metrics:
    - Establish metrics to evaluate the performance of the Virtual Assistant, such as response accuracy, contextual relevance, and user satisfaction.
    - Consider using user feedback and interactions to iteratively improve the model.

- Testing:
    - Conduct rigorous testing with a diverse set of Arch Linux users to validate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned model.
    - Compare the performance of the model before and after fine-tuning to measure improvements.

4. Iterative Improvement:

- Feedback Loop:
    - Implement a feedback loop where user interactions contribute to continuous improvement.
    - Regularly update the model based on user feedback and evolving user needs.
